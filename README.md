Dreamscapes ™ is a visual novel game with an exciting and immersive storyline game that puts you in the driver's seat of a dreamscape narrative. As you progress through the dreams, you'll encounter unexpected moments where you must make decisions by answering questions with multiple choices that will directly impact the outcome of the story. This offers a personalized and unique experience every time you play and makes you “never want to wake up.”
